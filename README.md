# Mist_FPGA  - DeMiSTified

This is a fork of Gehstock's MiST FPGA repository which contains many, many arcade FPGA cores, plus a few classic computer and console cores too.

I will port some of these to the Turbo Chameleon 64 platform, and this fork of the repo will hold the results.

So far, the cores ported to the DeMiSTify framework are:

* Vectrex
