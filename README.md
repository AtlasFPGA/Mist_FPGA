# Mist_FPGA  - DeMiSTified

This repository contains the Gehstock's MiST FPGA cores already ported to Deca, NeptUNO and other boards.  The full complete fork is at my repository https://github.com/somhi/Mist_FPGA

Original DeMiSTfication was done by Alastair M.Robinson https://github.com/robinsonb5/Mist_FPGA



I will port some of these to the DECA platform, and this repo will hold the results.

So far, the cores ported to the DeMiSTify framework are:

* Arcade Namco Pacman Hardware
